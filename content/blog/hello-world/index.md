Sugar is addictive. It activates the reward system in the brain. You eat some and you want more. Sugar makes you over-consume. It makes all the other stuff look bland. And it has been available in ample amounts and cheap prices for a long time which makes it even more dangerous.

But the topic of this article isn’t sugar. It is something similar. It is available everywhere nowadays, it is getting cheaper and cheaper, it is definitely addictive, it makes our normal lives look bland and it is always over consumed. It’s virtual entertainment. Streaming services, to be more precise.

Please do not worry. I am not some 80-year old uncle trying to get kids off those “Damn Phones”. I, myself, enjoy gaming and the occasional streaming. So hear me out.

Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar, etc. have been becoming increasingly popular. The roads are decorated with their advertisements, original content is continuously being produced and the quality is only getting better. But does this quality and convenience come with a cost ?

Distractions are easily available nowadays. Be it the phone, social media, notifications whatever. Our attention spans are decreasing. Focus is already not the easiest skill to master. Some distractions have already become a norm. In the earlier days, the sound of the phone used to be a constant annoyance, but thanks to the addictive nature of social media, the sound of a notification is now just a reason to jump towards the phone. Sometimes I open up my phone and don’t even consciously realize why I did that. Only to lose time going through comics.

None of these things can be unhealthy if done in a controlled, scheduled way. But honestly, how many times have we tried and failed to do so ? We are constantly flinching when sitting empty. There is always an itch to reach towards the phone and see what’s new with the world. Or sometimes it is used as a tool to escape the current moment.

Enter Netflix.

If you haven’t seen their recent advertisements, <a href="https://youtu.be/OOG1cyWghiI">here is a link.</a>

In these advertisements, Netflix claims that it is better to just stay at home and lose yourself in the world of cinema rather than being bored somewhere or being in an awkward situation. Sounds like an amazing option, right ? So what is wrong with it ?

The wrong thing is that Netflix is basically asking you to just numb yourself towards the experience of life. That is how addictions are created.

Life making you sad ? Netflix.

Boring night out ? Netflix.

Standing in a long queue ? Netflix instead.

Don’t want to trouble yourself with some weird things ? Just Netflix.

As if the world will take care of itself. As if all of those things that we are being told to skip aren’t a part of the human experience.

Am I going too far with my thinking ? Am I making up conspiracy theories ? These are fair questions.

Let me bring forth earlier claims by Netflix.

<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/netflix-downloads-sleep-biggest-competition-video-streaming-ceo-reed-hastings-amazon-prime-sky-go-a7690561.html">Netflix says its biggest competition is sleep</a>

Netflix CEO clearly stated that Netflix’s biggest enemy is sleep. He also pointed out that he preferred that people go to sleep late and watch Netflix instead. Netflix later confirmed their CEO’s words by tweeting “Sleep is my greatest enemy” on twitter. The tweet can be found on the link above.

This claim made me equally worried at that time. I wanted to warn people against this company’s claims. I wanted to tell them that this isn’t a healthy view held by a company which knows that it has a very addictive service to offer. I wanted to tell them that it will be detrimental to their health in the long run if they themselves don’t stay disciplined. But who would’ve listened to an average student going about saying Netflix is bad ? Because youngsters and millennials regard less sleep to be a ‘cool’ factor in their lives.

_These two surveys are the same. One is from the offcial site. The other is included to back up their claims._

<a href="https://azbigmedia.com/lifestyle/survey-74-of-netflix-users-dont-have-enough-time-to-get-7-hours-of-sleep/">Survey: 74% of Netflix users don't have enough time to sleep</a>

What I was afraid of came to pass. Although these figures are from the USA, the situation isn’t much different in India either. I personally know friends and relatives who would stream a series in a dark room at night rather than try to have a sound sleep. Netflix said it was trying to defeat sleep and it is arguably winning. Of course it isn’t some evil mind controlling company therefore people can discipline themselves, but as I stated earlier, new content plus high quality makes for an addictive product.

Now, Netflix is trying to put a new idea in people’s head — some life experiences aren’t worth having, so Netflix instead. Many people will totally agree with this notion without giving it a second thought. Why get bored when you have so many amazing things to watch right in your smartphone ?My answer is a little philosophical. Long answer short — Every experience in life is worth having.

The problem is that habits form when we get rewarded for things we do. When we find a series to be good, it rewards us. We feel good about watching it. So we think….well, this was good, so why don’t I stay at home tomorrow as well instead of doing some boring work and watch some more Netflix ? You can do the same thing during work, practice, classes, etc. Netflix is addictive, true….but what makes it more troublesome is the stuff it takes away in return. Increasing desire of escaping the present moment numbs you to the experience of life itself. Our lives will seem dull in front of the lives of rogue agents, perfect couples and superheroes. But you have to keep in mind that it is not a competition. You do not have to tune out of your life just because it gets tough or boring at times. The more you stream the scripted lives of others, the more dull your life will feel. When it feels that way you will again tune in to watch more action. The reality is that we cannot live the lives of the protagonists of our favorite stories. We only have our lives in hand. The present moment is good enough for us to stay in it and experience it because it counts as life too. Boredom and awkwardness aren’t something new, therefore we need not succumb to the marketing idea that we need to avoid them as much as we can.

When we have learned how to accept our present moments in life without passing judgement on ourselves and the world, then we can decide for ourselves what we would like to do in that moment and that can include Netflix.But, when we say we would rather Netflix than deal with life, we are putting ourselves in a losing position.

“I am doing good. I am awesome now let’s watch some movies”

is better than

“Life sucks anyways. Nothing I do will improve anything. Let’s Netflix instead.”

_(I do understand that I have no rights to judge anyone. So, this is just my personal opinion. On some days, when you are feeling down you might just wanna netflix instead and watch your favourite shows and that is fine too. My problem is with Netflix promoting this as a lifestyle. Just like going to the theatre all the time is not a sensible lifestyle, therefore just because movies are now in your pocket doesn't mean that Netflix should be asking you to keep your eyes glued to them. Not to forget that they already don't want you to sleep.)_

I personally believe that having the thought process of the former kind will be liberating while binge watching and will not suffocate you with the guilt of being lazy or useless which the latter thought process does. We keep worrying constantly about what might happen when we leave it all on chance therefore I think we cannot just throw our hands in the air and say, “Fuck it. Let’s Netflix instead.”

The new advertisements of Netflix can be rephrased as — why feel when you can Netflix instead.
