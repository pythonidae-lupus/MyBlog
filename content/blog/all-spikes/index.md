I am a firm believer in the power of “daily affirmations”, meaning that every morning, I write about the kind of person I am or want to become and I believe that my mind picks it up subconsciously. The mind is a really powerful tool and as long as science is baffled by how it works and can’t teach us everything about it, I think we can all perform some (optimistic) experiments to check what works for us and what doesn’t. So far, I have accomplished some characteristic traits that I had written down as my affirmations therefore, it does work for me.

One of those affirmations (in fact the first one ) is that I am enough. I write this daily and say it out loud too if I feel like it.

I first heard about the idea of daily affirmations from Tim Ferris’s book “Tools of titans”. It was actually a tool called “5-min journal” and it is a daily habit of writing what you are grateful for, what you would like to do today, your daily affirmations, amazing things that happened to you that day and how could you have made the day better. Yes, it is a productivity tool and yes it works great because I have been doing it since the past two years.

So, okay daily affirmations done. but where did I get the idea of writing “I am enough” and why do I think it is important ? To answer this, I present to you a link to a podcast episode I listened to on Mindvalley. In this podcast, Marisa Peer talks about how many of our problems with our own identity, or addiction to something are linked to the feeling of us not being enough.

Marisa Peer is a world-renowned therapist and a best-selling author.

I know that not everyone is interested in listening to podcasts, but check this one out if you can find the motivation. We all either have struggled, are struggling or will struggle with mental health issues in our lifetime. They can be minor like some temporary stress or major like depression, anxiety, etc.

Marisa Peer talks about some real-life cases and how she helped her clients overcome some hurdles by asking them to believe in the fact that they are enough (of course it wasn’t as simple as this but this was the underlying motive. Listen to the podcast for in-depth information).

But the thought that “I am enough” raises one question with everybody who thinks about it a little — if I really am enough, then does that mean that I should stop all me endeavors ? Does that mean that I do not need to achieve anything else in my life and that I am perfect in every aspect ? The answer may seem tricky at first but bear with me.

First of all, enough and perfect aren’t synonyms. If someone is pouring water for me and I say “enough”, it of course doesn’t mean that it is the most perfect glass of water I have ever received. It just means that I know it will be enough to quench my thirst. Similarly, when you believe that you are enough, you simply mean that you have all the potential to accomplish your goals.

Being enough means you can’t excuse yourself by saying “if only I had that I would be able to do this”, “if only I was this way, I would have ended up like that”. Being enough means you are fully accountable for the events in your life (except the natural disasters or major world events involving multiple layers that are in no one’s control). This gives you full control of your life and removes the tendency of blaming it on your luck or the circumstances. Yes! Writing “I am enough” everyday on a piece of paper can do that for you. Once you realize that everything will eventually begin with you taking the first step, you can start making the plans and putting the pieces together.

Instead of stopping you in your tracks, the feeling of being enough will push you forward, because you will start to believe that all you need is yourself. Then, you can stop being afraid of things that “might” happen on your journey, stop procrastinating, and start moving ahead.

Okay, so now we are ready to embark on this confidence inducing journey and filling up our journals with I am enough. I have been always motivated by this feeling too. And like any other morning, I woke up once, finished with my journal, spent some time with myself, and opened my phone and the first pic on Instagram I see is of one of the people I look up to, Tom Bilyeu, and he said that he believes in the fact that he isn’t good enough which motivates him and makes him strive harder for everything.

Now, I know you might be thinking, “Well, it is just a personal preference.” And I believed that too, until the reasoning he provided started to make so much sense to me that it made me rethink my stand on the issue. Of course it pushes him forward. When you think you are perfect you wouldn’t try to get any better at the craft. I was perplexed. How can “I am enough” and “I am not good enough” both make sense at the same time. It felt like a paradox. I spent days trying to figure out some missing piece as to why this was happening. Was I really just supposed to choose a random option and do some trial and error experiments. That’s what it looked like in the beginning and I chose the option of believing in “I am enough” as it had been helping me since 2 years already. But the thought never left my head. I started asking myself whether me not improving at a faster pace had something to do with my belief of being enough. This confusion went on for a few more days, after which something else occupied the front seat in my head and this went to the back. But one day, I decided to bring it to my attention once again. Tom had spoken against the sentence “I am good enough" and also tweeted about the same. Labeling “I am not good enough” as a natural human thought that makes us work more and push harder. I, then, tried to figure out the difference between my belief and the statement he was talking against.

“I am enough” vs “I am good enough”
“I am enough” vs “I am good enough”
“I am enough” vs “I am good enough”
“enough” vs “good enough”

And then it struck me.

For me, the difference in the statements was the usage of the word “good”. It adds a comparative degree to the word “enough”. While “enough” means “to be adequate”, “good enough” means to be “complete; full; perfect”.

Where there is good, there can always be better. I think our mind sees that at the subconscious level. While the statement “I am enough” has nothing to do with the job or the skill you are working on, “I am good enough” labels you either as an expert, or as a person who needs no more learning or practice and can take care of the task at hand right away.
For example, if you have to learn a new skill which you need at your new job but you keep saying, “I am good enough” to every employer, they will soon start seeing you as an arrogant person who is not willing to learn.

“I am good enough” can be used like the sentence “I am enough" in some cases but there are conditions to it. One of the most important of those conditions is that you don’t let it get to your own head. Because the former statement presents to yourself a picture of the perfect person, which one can never be. There is always room to improve. But, by reciting it daily, you might sell yourself the idea that good enough = perfect, and once it gets seated in your mind it’s tough to overcome.

Another major difference in these two statements is that there will be many situations in one’s lifetime when they just don’t feel good enough. Maybe you get fired from your job, or you go through a major breakup, or you blame yourself for someone else’s loss. In these times, it’s not easy to say “I am good enough". Sometimes you just know that you weren’t good enough. Because if you were, things wouldn’t have happened the way they did. You would still have that job if you were good enough for it, or you would still be in the relationship if your partner thought you were good enough. But even in these tough times, you can still feel enough. Because “not being enough for a job” doesn’t really make much sense as a statement. The feeling of being enough isn’t based on others' perception of you. It’s an inner feeling. You make yourself feel enough. You are enough and that is why you can start afresh, you are enough and that is why you have the power to learn more new things, you are enough and that is why you can make improvements in yourself as a person. You being “good enough” removes the possibility of any improvement because you are already perfect.
Being enough is a feeling on the inside. Being good enough is subject to a lot of external circumstances including the most fickle of all, other people’s perception of you. Good enough can be used as a metric for determining your quality of work, which makes it tough to be used like being enough which is just an abstract notion.

I think that when you are enough for yourself, no one else in your life will never be not enough for you. Why would you need someone else to fill a place within you. Isn’t the whole place inside you, you? You and you alone can ever make yourself feel fulfilled. Even your loving partner cannot fill the holes within you if you don’t mend some of them yourselves. And what if you want to be selfless and help others who feel downed by life? Well, only when you feel enough can you give out to others. If a glass is itself not full, how can it provide water to others without becoming empty in the end? To give freely to others, to fill other glasses, a glass needs to be overflowing itself. So that it can give to others unbounded by the fear of self harm.

If someone tells you “you aren’t good enough”, it means you can improve on some skill or ability of yours. But if someone says “you aren’t enough for me”, it is quiet possible that it is them who isn’t able to feel enough for themselves. It is them who needs the support to feel that they can be helping themselves and that they can be a more fulfilled person by themselves.
You need to be enough for yourself before someone else can be that for you. A glass that is only half full cannot blame others of being not enough for it, can it ?
