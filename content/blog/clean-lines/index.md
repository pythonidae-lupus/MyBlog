_(Although I have used my example of being an “artist” in this post, I am not a professional artist. I am a hobbyist looking for professional exposure.)_

“I have done some back-breaking work but the results are unimpressive.”

“I have worked much harder than that guy and he still got the promotion?!”

“She does not work as hard as me yet she still outperforms me.”

Do these sentences sound familiar? Chances are you, or someone you know, has uttered things of this nature. No matter how hard we try, things don’t always line up for us. We feel underappreciated, we start doubting ourselves and then we watch a motivational speech and start “working harder” (The reason I put it inside quotes is because I believe that we have been using that term in a wrong way). I believe that we have been measuring the work we do with the wrong metrics, but still are expecting the correct results. Sometimes that might work, but in most cases it will leave you unsatisfied, unmotivated or even burned out.

The prevalent meaning of “hard work”

When we say we “work hard”, we usually mean that we worked so much that we either have a physical pain or mental stress (or both). I have seen this a lot and have personally experienced a fair share of this. After a day of work, people can usually be recorded saying things such as —
“I worked so much that my head is aching.”

or

“My back is aching because of all the hard work I did today in the office.”

or (one that I have seen a lot )

people hold their forehead and say
“I have been working so hard lately. I need a break.”

My advice to you is — STOP!
Don’t stop working. But definitely stop thinking that “working hard” means you have to have some kind of stress in your body.
Using stress to measure hard work is like using an athlete’s pain to measure the distance she/he has covered in a race.
I like watching GaryVee’s YouTube videos and Tom Bilyeu’s Impact Theory videos (Check those out! They are amazing!) and come across terms such as hustle, grind, work, etc. and even if you don’t watch them, you do hear this from many other people who have achieved financial success or people who have achieved their dreams. But whenever we hear those words they trigger the image of sweat, sleep deprived eyes, hunched back, neck-breaking routine, gritted teeth and what not! And until now I used to think of it the same way. Every time I wanted to work hard towards something, I would run towards the goal so damn fast that my feet would break before ever reaching the finish line. But, things changed when I truly began to understand the meaning of “Do what you love”.
Almost all the people who we admire and listen to, whom we think of as our role models actually enjoy what they do. So, they enjoy doing the work to the point where it does not seem like work at all. It is their reason to jump out of bed every morning. Whenever we watch or listen to them, they almost never appear to be really drained or sleep deprived. So what is it that these people got right and we did not. Is there a secret potion that we can drink to instantly be extremely passionate about something? Although I would definitely want a serving of that if it really exists but for now all I have to tell you about is the concept of Flow.

<h2>Flow</h2>

Many of us have, at least once in our lives, experienced flow. I sometimes experience it whenever I paint or draw. What happens to me is that I enjoy every moment of it. The concept of time is removed as I am present in the NOW. All I care about when I am drawing is the drawing itself. I can postpone other activities I love because I just enjoy it so much. I don’t get so tired as to dread my work. I feel rejuvenated because I am doing something that I enjoy to my core.
And it’s not just drawing. I feel the same way about playing games, Reading books (fiction and non-fiction both), solving puzzles (especially based on the concepts of physics).
Find your flow —

<ul>
<li>You love the thing while you are doing it.</li>
<li>Time does not seem to be a problem.</li>
<li>It fuels you instead of draining your energy.</li>
<li>You feel free and fluid.</li>
</ul>

Chances are that you too have at least once felt this flow. This is where you do your best work and never feel tired because you just enjoy it so much. The work itself fuels your energy. Therefore at the end of it all, you might feel tired but not stressed or burned out.

<h2>Efficient Hard Work</h2>

Just like a runner has a set distance to run, we all should have a set goal to achieve in a day/week/month/year. For example, since I write blogs on Medium, I have a goal to put out one blog per week. Therefore my goal for a day can be to write the first draft of my blog or half of my blog, then another day I can review it, and so on.
By doing this, we are taking constant steps towards the completion of our work. These steps can either be the size of a baby’s or Bigfoot’s. We will then be making actual progress in our work without feeling the stress or pain. But it is always hard to let go of an old habit and conditioned thinking. At the end of the day, if we don’t feel “tired enough” or our neck doesn’t hurt, it will be easy for us to think that we hadn’t done enough work. If we had, we wouldn’t be feeling so energetic and fresh. In these times, it will help to compare the progress of our work with the achievements of the previous day, which will ensure that we are on the right track and also that we are a better version of ourselves than we were yesterday.
By setting the right evaluation metrics, we can make actual progress which depends on the quality and/or quantity of the work rather than our stamina. This will also ensure that we don’t burnout too soon because we did not know when to stop. Work stops being fun when it starts feeling like “work”. Take something that you love. If you do it for a while, it is refreshing but if you do it all day, it suddenly makes you feel lethargic and bored. This does not mean that we will never work long hours. But we will at least stop treating our fatigue as our award.
Efficient hard work will result in desirable results while “supposed” hard work is like a treadmill — you won’t get anywhere but will feel tired anyways.

<h3>Efficient Hard Work as a Step Towards Achieving Flow</h3>

The difference between Flow and Efficient hard-work is that flow is a state of mind and a state of being while efficient hard-work is a metric to measure our progress and productivity. But both of them lead us to the same thing. Efficient hard-work is something that will help you achieve the state of flow.
When we see people talking about flowing instead of grinding or hustling, we come to believe that these two ideas are at the opposite ends of a spectrum. But I have come to understand that it is not the case.

When successful people talk about flowing, they mean doing something you love so much that it takes over you. When such a thing happens, you will not even notice the hours you put into the work and will just enjoy every aspect of it. Since the work will fuel you, you won’t feel tired very soon.

Efficient hard-work says the same thing. The catch is that when we are in a state of flow and end up doing a lot of work it doesn’t occur to us as “hard-work” because we didn’t even feel like working, and also because it did not make us all sweaty and aching as described by the image of hard-work in our mind but to outsiders, the ones who saw us accomplish big tasks in a work spree, it seems like really hard-work, it seems like The Hustle, The Grind and all the other buzz words. But of course we, to some degree, are aware that we are doing a lot of work when we are in a state of flow and that is why you hear some successful people say things like grind and work-hard because although they are so passionate about the work that the obstacles are perceived by them as something that can be won over, it is still hard-work getting over them. What makes it efficient hard-work is that they are going somewhere, they are progressing in some way, they are growing as a person.
“But I saw a GaryVee post saying he did not take any days off for 20 years and he did not party and all he did was hustle. He did not talk about flow.”
But he did talk about passion though, right? It wasn’t useless energy exertion. If he wanted to do that he would have been in the gym 9 to 5 just curling with 5 kg dumbbells. He was passionate about being an entrepreneur and about wine.

Flow does not happen when we are stuck in the past or the future. It is in the present. It is in the NOW. So, for example, when I am sketching in a state of flow, I do not care about what happened in the day or what is about to come. I am fully present with paper and the pencil. But if you ask me about a drawing that I made an year ago, of course I will say that it takes work and practice. I cannot say that “I was in a state of flow”. This answer will be too vague and useless. The former is practical, although cliche, advice. But the thing we miss about this advice is that although I say it is a lot of work and practice, it won’t feel like a burden if you actually enjoy the art.


Then we might end up thinking that we aren’t working enough just because we aren’t feeling exhausted, but then again, that’s the whole point of this article. Do not use exhaustion as a metric. The one metric that is fit for any work or skill is “Am I better than yesterday?” or “Have I grown as compared to yesterday?”

Other simpler and less philosophical metrics are —
<ul>
<li>The quantity of work</li>
<li>The quality which you can determine using feedback from people.</li>
<li>The feeling of happiness.</li>
<li>How close are you to the target you set. (Set a final target without a deadline if you have the luxury of time and just set out to achieve it even through baby steps. But the work done should be an improvement or must add to something done the previous day).</li>
</ul>
