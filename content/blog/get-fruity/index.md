description: But it somehow always felt wrong.
---
When I was a child, I used to make cards stating my dad to be “My Superhero”, “The best dad ever”. I never talked to him in depth. I just wrote that because every other kid did that and I felt that that is what I was supposed to do as well. But now that I have matured, I feel that we need to address our relationships as they are, because that is the only way those relations can move forward and become stronger.

My relationship with my dad has been quite an adventure. We hug, we argue, we shout, we talk. I know, I know….what kind of selfish child writes such an article on Father’s Day? I do not think that this is self-serving. I address many issues and apologize to my dad for times I hurt him. I cannot keep ignoring the truth. For as much as we, as the next generation, criticize our parents, I think there are some issues with our thinking that we need to address too.

This one is for my dad. This is the truth. I hope this also helps other people with similar childhoods and helps them make there relationships stronger as well. If you feel like sharing this article with your parents then feel free to do so.

“You should have a good handwriting. Work more on that.”

“Score 90% marks in your school. That is the only thing which is valuable.”

“Do you Yoga and meditation. It is good for you.”

“Have a plan B.”

“Go to a hostel for your IIT studies.”

“Go for an MBA not a Master’s. That way you will earn more.”

These are the things my dad usually said to me. Some of those statements are still spoken by my father. But all of them echo in my mind once in a while. For as long as I can remember, I have always contested these statements. Even if I did those same things later on, I would still argue about them in the beginning. But, why? I certainly love my dad. I respect him for all his hard work, his experience and the sacrifices he has made for me. Then I must be a sadist, right? I just like arguing and hurting his feelings ? But that’s not true either.

I am pretty sure that this problem isn’t mine alone. I have heard many father-son relationships dictated mostly by conflicts and arguments. None of them is able to get their points across.

One day I decided to analyse why my communication with my dad has always been a roller-coaster ride. It was tough to admit my shortcomings, but I had to do it if I wanted our relationship to ever succeed. I spent many minutes of my days day-dreaming, playing different scenarios in my head, trying to figure out the disconnect that seemed to be plaguing our relation for so many years.

But it was only when I started reading about what healthy relationships are and what the characteristics of such relations are that I truly began to understand what was going wrong in my life.

**The Generation Gap**

Being from completely different generations, we both weren’t able to empathize with each other. We never understood the other person’s point of view and fail to do so to this day. Since my dad has always been the one giving me advice and it was never the other way around, he needed to understand this more than me. I mean….he’s the parent after all.
All of his advice was based on his life experience. He wouldn’t view them from a child’s point of view and was not able to view the difference between generations and I do not blame him of course. It is not easy at all to grow up in one world, and to grow old in a completely different one.

For example, meditation was something he always advised me to do. I even tried it with him on a few occasions, but I didn’t like it. I later realized that the real issue was that my dad did not know how to meditate properly either. He just did the best he could.And since he himself did not know the correct way, how could he teach me ? But he would always assume that I did not do it out of spite. Lack of empathy made this possible.

Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. — Google dictionary.

Empathy is the key for any kind of communication.I think the relationship between me and my dad would have been much better if we both had implemented this. Although, now my father is being much more empathetic than me and I have noticed it. The ability to see the world through your child’s or your parent’s eyes is so powerful! Empathy makes me feel understood. Empathy lets me know that the person I am talking to respects me enough to try and see things from my point-of-view.

One simple heart-to-heart talk could have fixed several issues we faced when I was a child. Of course, the issues are more complicated now.

**Experience through age versus Experience through work**

This is a common argument.

Respect your elders because they know more. Because they have seen more. Because they have lived more.

And it is quite true in many areas of life. But, it is equally false elsewhere.
Having lived through so many years of schooling myself, I tend to manage my younger brother’s life. Experience gives me the confidence and the tools to be able to help him navigate through life with relative ease. But our age doesn’t necessarily reflect the knowledge we have attained. The knowledge that we have gained through living and experiencing life is useful only in a certain context.

If I was to teach my brother about the slang popular in his school right now, I would fail miserably. Of course I would! That knowledge is completely new and my “Experience of schooling” might be radically different than his, due to so many years having passed by.

But, nobody’s perfect. Therefore, having come so far in life and having experienced a wide array of things, our ego gets attached to our stature. We do not like being questioned. The veil of ignorance makes it harder to see that our knowledge is either irrelevant or outdated in certain cases. We overcome many hardships in our individual, personal lives. These victories might not be large enough to celebrate with a grand event, but these small wins are still registered subconsciously. Now, who the hell is a teenager to challenge someone like me who has seen way more difficulty than him/her ? I have gone through so many things in my life that I can guide this child the right way, right?

I do not agree with that. There is a difference between the knowledge you can get through your experience of life and the knowledge you can only get through studying and applying a particular skill.

For example, my dad always told me to work on my personality and work on being more confident around other people. He also advised me to not be afraid of meeting new people (I used to be scared when I was younger). And all this advice was golden. My life would’ve been much better if I had followed through it and I do hold myself responsible for not taking it seriously. But this is actually the kind of knowledge that experience can provide. After living through 40 years of life, you learn a lot about human behavior, people skills, management skills, personality, etc. because you observe these things daily in life. These are fundamental to the way of human life and parents are almost always right when they are teaching this to their children. My father was too.

On the other hand, my dad also used to advise me on what courses I should take, which colleges I should try to get into, what my career should look, my hairstyle and the programming languages/software I should learn. The problem with this category is that all of this is time-sensitive i.e., it changes quickly with time. Plus, my father had no experience in many of those fields. He didn’t know programming. He had always been in a particular field in his career and there are just so many fields of work he is unfamiliar to. Some of them he does not even know about. Due to this, his advice, though well-meaning, was always lacking in evidence and facts. Almost all of our parents mean well for us. But due to many of their world-views having converted to rigid beliefs as they grow, they may become assertive to a fault. It is never a good idea to advise someone on a thing you yourself haven’e experienced, even if you are a parent.

Parents tend to have a blurred the lines between the information they have gained through experience and which is relevant in everyone’s lives, and information that they just like to believe in. But there is a stark difference. Many times, the children know about a topic far more than their parents — which programming language is popular, which study plan they should follow, which courses are worth looking into,etc. But parents are in denial of the fact that when they speak about such things, they are speaking out their personal opinion and not from a point of view of a person experienced in such issues.

Even if they mean well, they might be wrong about a topic.

Meaning well does not mean knowing well. Be vocal about the things you have first-hand experience with and be an advisor about things you have equal or less knowledge than the child.

I just want to say that even when my dad did talk about the things he was actually experienced in, I never took them seriously. I have started to listen to him more but this change came after a certain level of maturity. I hope any child reading this develops empathy which they use to see the point of view of their parents and give their opinions a chance.

**Admitting when you are wrong**

Whenever we are challenged by someone much younger than us, it is our ego that gets hurt. And I might be wrong, but from my childhood experience, a new layer of ego gets added to one’s personality when they become a parent. Let us call this parental ego.

This ego is quite similar to the one that a boss has towards their employees. It forces you to never admit your shortcomings because you fear that you might lose authority over your employees if you show others that you are vulnerable and capable of committing mistakes. (Of course their maybe some other factors in play and this is just my view and opinion).

So, what happens when you never question your judgement and never admit your mistake ? You become rigid. Very rigid. My father ( and my mother too ) have a tough time admitting there mistakes in front of us. Although, I have sometimes overheard their conversations where they talk to each other about being wrong and how they can do things better, but even then it did not help me much. I was still subjected to do as they wished without an apology or even an acceptance of things gone wrong. But I am expected to apologize when the situation is reversed.

We are always taught that apologizing when you have made a mistake is good manners and everyone should do it. It hurts when the ones who taught us themselves do not follow the teaching.

Admit when you are wrong and apologize. I always felt trapped and disrespected when that did not happen and it just increased the friction in our relation. This applies to children too.

**Trust**

All kinds of relationships have trust issues. They might concern different things in context of different relationships, but the fundamental block still remains the lack of trust.

To be fair, my dad has always placed trust in me when it came to big decisions. I think I am more guilty in this area. I didn’t trust him while I was growing up as much as I should have.

Trust issues can only be mended by spending time with each other. When you get to know a person in an intimate way, you are able to see where they are coming from when they say certain things. You understand that they mean good and in the end, they just want to see you succeed whether you do what you want or what they want.

**Clash of ideologies**

This will never go away.

I have mostly seen a father and child follow many opposing ideologies. This can be blamed on the generation gap, different atmosphere of upbringing, age, etc. but the problem still persists. I am very firmly against some of my father’s ideologies. In such cases, I either avoid the topic or fall into an argument.
But as the popular saying goes —
“You can disagree with someone and still love them”.

I have found it to be true in many of my relations. My father believes in many things that I do not. But, my dad is a very good person nevertheless.
Not much can be said about this problem to be honest. Ideologies will always clash. We just need to set a limit up to which we can forgive the person in front of us. When it comes to family, dealing with love should be the first step.

**Great Expectations**

This never gets old, does it?

As long as the Sun shines, parents (at least in Asia) will always have big expectations from their children. Sometimes, it is about the child. Parents see the potential in their children (overestimate sometimes) and expect more from them so that they outperform themselves. It does work in some situations. But sometimes, the expectations become more about the parent. Then the child is just expected to follow like a sheep. Even in this case, the parent believes that the child is to benefit, but if we dig deep down, we come to realize that it is either the parent’s unfinished dream or their own desire which they want their child to accomplish.

But the thing is that no matter what you do for another human being, you still have to let them go at some point in time. People get crushed under the weight of the expectations. Some people break.

It is important to realize that your child has a way of living different than yours. It is important to realize that your teachings are the only things that will stay with them after a point in life. It is important to trust those teachings and your child.

This also means that our parents are rarely proud of us, or rarely express it. When I scored good points in my 10th boards, I got on the phone with a very proud father on the other side. I haven’t heard him express his pride like that ever since and I have kept chasing that high. I wouldn’t fully blame him because there aren’t many amazing things I accomplished after that, but it would be nice to hear it now and then to be honest.

“Look, sometimes… people drift apart, Miles. And I don’t want that to happen to us, okay? Look, I know I don’t always do what you need me to do or say what you need me to say, but I… I see this… this spark in you, it’s amazing, it’s why I push you. But it’s yours, and whatever you choose to do with it, you’ll be great.”
— Mile’s dad, Jefferson Davis, Spiderman: Into the spider-verse.

For the kids born in the 90's, I believe their parents have led a tougher life than them. This applies to me as well. My father has been through many hardships from his college days to the present. He worked hard to ensure that the same things do not happen to me. To say that my life is harder than my parents would be disrespectful towards their hard work.

What we can say is that we have a different set of challenges now which they might not understand because these problems did not simply exist in their time.
My parents have worked hard to be where they are in life.

My dad and I will continue to have many different opinions and many arguments. I will never give up on what I believe to be right and will keep fighting for it because that is what I have learned from my father and other leaders. Do not be scared dad, trust in your parenting because you have raised me well, and you are always on my mind while I make some decision.

I just want my dad to know that even if I do not have a successful career in my early twenties, he must remember that life isn’t kind to the people it wants to carve into champions. It wasn’t kind to you either dad and look at you a now a champion indeed! I might not be able to live according to your expectations in the beginning, but I will end up a champion too because you have taught me right.

I always keep your image and your teachings in my mind
Don’t worry about me going wrong because you have taught me right
In every decision, I picture you here by my side.

**What does “being right” mean ?**

So as you might have noticed, the word ‘right’ in my title is within quotation marks. The reason is that no one knows what the absolute right way is. By saying that my father was almost always “right”, I mean to say that he was right according to his worldviews. If I would have lived exactly the way he wanted me to, I might by now have had a job (I am a final year student) and that to him seems right. On the other hand, If I follow my path and I bag an admission in a good college for post-graduation, or I get a good offer from a company or I set up my own business he would still be as much happy, if not more. To him, that would be right as well.

All opinions of two people will never be the same no matter what relationship they have. You can only do what you think is right.

There were times when my dad was actually right and I did not listen to him. But, there were and still are times when my dad is right in his own way and I am right in my own. As long as the outcome is good, the opinions of the individual held before the event do not matter.

If there is one thing that I have come to understand about parents, it is that they always want what is good for their children. Sometimes, the children might fail to understand what the parents are aiming at and in such cases, a conversation about it will be helpful. In other cases, children might have opposing views and in those times, we must remember that as long as we make something of our lives and are able to become self-dependent, our parents would still be proud of us and might even change their own thoughts. It is almost magical what parents are willing to do for their children.

My dad wants to see me succeed in life. He wants to make sure that his son can lead a good life with or without him, so that he can live his life contently having known that his family is living a good life and when the time comes, he can enjoy his retirement in bliss knowing that his loved ones will forever be grateful for his love and sacrifices and also will be living a happy life themselves.

This reminds me of the scene after the battle in Avengers : Endgame. Pepper tells Tony that he can rest, they (his family) will be fine. I felt that resonating with me because I feel that my father has the same worries keeping him up at night sometimes. Yes, my dad is my iron man.

Dad, we will be fine and you can now be stress free.
I love you, dad.
Happy Father’s Day.
