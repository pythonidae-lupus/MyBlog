The biggest concern with the rising popularity of Artificial Intelligence is unemployment in various job sectors. But, there is something that is going to change on a micro scale as well. It might not be as disruptive as millions losing their jobs but it can still affect individuals in a way which will change their way of life.

Artificial Intelligence brings with it machines and automation. Which means less human labor. It also means less involvement of humans in production. Gone are the days when traditional methods were the norm. Now, due to advancements in technology, everything can be produced faster which makes consumers want things even faster. This vicious cycle of supply and demand keeps the consumers wanting for more. Automation will make things even quicker. Tesla already has automated car manufacturing in place. Amazon is looking for automating its delivery with drones. When humans are taken out of the equation, humanity ceases to exist.

Due to the continuous bombardment of data nowadays, we are usually mentally stressed. The number of individuals stressed due to the constant influx of data is increasing. There is so much information floating around that it overwhelms our brain sometimes. I literally reached for my phone just now as I was thinking of the next sentence to write. That’s how much I have been affected by continuous data input.

_What does AI have to do with all this ?_

When was the last time you were fully in the moment. When was it that you were about 100% aware of your body, breath, environment ? For me it is when I am either around the people I love dearly because in those moments, I lose the tendency of reaching out to my phone, or it is when I am working on things I am passionate about, solving problems, etc. I assume this is also where many other people feel fully aware although it might not be limited to just these things. Now, AI is not doing anything to our loved ones (yet) but it will soon be taking over our tasks. (I reached for my phone again wtf. I don’t even have any messages to check). Due to this, we will lose some of the moments that help us focus and draw attention to the present. The absence of mindfulness not only diminishes the experience of living to our full potential but it also removes humanity from the process.

**AI will lead to more exploitation of nature**

Just think about it, the consumption of non-vegetarian food has led to exploitation of various animal species. We can argue that it is because of growing population and permanent settlements, but there is one more factor to be considered. People let others do the dirty business for them. I am a non-vegetarian too, but my consumption of such meals is limited to once or twice a month. But, there are some people who consume meat everyday twice. If a law was to be formed which asked people to kill their food themselves instead of it readily being available in packages and slaughterhouses, many people would not be able to stomach it.

We, including myself, are able to live in the blissful ignorance of the activities inside a slaughterhouse because we are so far removed from it. Now, imagine going one step further and replacing humans with machines. Machines don’t feel. Machines can kill much more than humans can.

<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/31/how-killing-animals-everyday-leaves-slaughterhouse-workers-traumatised-7175087/">https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/31/how-killing-animals-everyday-leaves-slaughterhouse-workers-traumatised-7175087/</a>

One way of looking at this is that those people working in slaughterhouses will benefit from automation (although they will be losing their jobs so it is not an obvious benefit ) but then the exploitation of animals will only increase further. Humanity is already on the losing side in this battle. Machines will kill it altogether.

Automation will also make activities like mining and felling faster and less riskier. The decision to exploit this or not will be with the people heading these industries, so people choosing the environment over profits seems like wishful thinking for now.

**AI will affect our personal lives greatly**

AI will take away mindfulness in other fields too. Online food ordering services have made it convenient for people to eat food without going through the hassle of planning for a special evening, dressing up, meeting strangers and eating in a noisy restaurant. But it has also led people to be less mindful of their diet and eating habits, sanitary conditions of the food, the mannerisms of living in a society, etc.

AI made a domestic debut with Roomba, the house cleaning robot. Imagine being so deep in technology that cleaning our own houses has to be done by robots. We aren’t mindful of how are house is arranged and where some things are kept. It is an inconvenience we don’t think twice about before eliminating.

When we are so far detached from the present moment, we are detached from feelings of gratitude, joy and focus. I recently watched a documentary regarding dairy products. The person in-charge of milking the cows just placed a machine on their udders and stepped back talking and laughing with the camera crew. This won’t be of any concern to most people, but to me it was a window to the future when we will be much more dependent on machines and will start taking things for granted. I think there should be a degree of gratitude and respect when taking something from another living being. That respect can be shown by actually giving a damn about the task.

AI will bring with it crazy fast data transfers. A large amount of the population is already suffering from smartphone addiction. We fidget and use our phones to escape any social situation we feel uncomfortable in. This serves as a roadblock in the path of developing interpersonal skills. We refuse to be in the NOW and can easily go talk to a machine instead to calm our nerves. I understand that smartphones aren’t the result of AI, but they are affecting our quality to focus in a way, that makes the rising popularity of AI a little more dangerous.

**Conclusion**

Artificial intelligence isn’t my enemy. The fact that we are voluntarily giving-up control of the minute thing in our lives is what troubles me. When we will be surrounded by automation, there won’t be many things we can be mindful in doing. A saw makes it easier to cut a tree, but the use of an axe makes you appreciate nature and makes you work hard when you decide to take something away from her. Machines are increasingly making it easier for us to exploit the natural resources and turning a blind eye to it. They are also making our attention span shorter with continuous data inputs.

In the end, the extent to which you participate in the AI industry is your choice. Do not lose track of things that are important to you. AI isn’t the enemy, it is the absence of ethical guidelines and modern laws which will lead to exploitation and harmful action on part of the AI. Since, it is humans who will be having the final say in the creation as well as the deployment of new technologies, we will have the responsibility to deem something useful or harmful based on its past record (if any) and on all the possible outcomes of its usage.

But, giving up control for convenience need not be the end of mindfulness. Instead, we can train our minds to be mindful in any situation with help of mindfulness meditation and practicing social-media abstention periodically. As for the exploitation of nature, ethical laws need to be in place but people have still not realized the full potential of automation, especially the older people running the governments which puts our future in a cloud of uncertainty which is tending to rain on the negative side.
